    "Several factors influence an individual's lifespan, including genetics, environmental conditions, behavior, and diet. Genetics determines our susceptibility to certain diseases and influences our body’s ability to repair itself (Smulders and Deelen, 2023)<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). Environmental factors like air quality, access to healthcare, and socioeconomic status also play a role in longevity (Passarino et al., 2016)<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4). Behaviors such as physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and stress management significantly impact health outcomes (Wang et al., 2023)<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5). Diet, however, is one of the most modifiable factors affecting lifespan. A balanced diet can prevent chronic diseases, reduce inflammation, and support overall health (Caprara, 2018<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1); Willcox et al., 2007<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2)). The goal of our project is to investigate how a country’s production of different foods (plant-based or animal-based) affects life expectancy-specific. We aim to identify which of these diets may help reduce the risk of age-related diseases and promote longevity.\n",
    "\n",
    "A study by Caprara (2018) <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) analyzed how different diets reduce non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs are diseases that do not transfer from person to person through infectious agents (heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and chronic lung disease). In the study, Caprara examined seven different dietary patterns to assess their potential in reducing the prevalence and impact of these conditions. The diets studied included the Mediterranean diet, known for its emphasis on healthy fats, fruits, and vegetables; the Japanese diet, which is rich in fish, rice, and plant-based foods; the vegetarian diet, which eliminates animal products; the new Nordic diet, which focuses on locally sourced, seasonal foods; the fast-mimicking diet, which simulates the effects of fasting while still providing essential nutrients; and the caloric restriction diet, which involves reducing calorie intake without malnutrition.These diets, common in Blue Zones where people live longer, share key features: high intake of plant-based foods, whole grains, unsaturated fats, and moderate protein, with a focus on omega-3s and antioxidants. They also limit red meat, processed foods, and sugars. Caprara also claimed that adopting a plant-based diet, alongside intermittent fasting and active living, can significantly reduce NCD risk and promote a longer, healthier life.\n",
    "\n",
    "A study by Willcox et al. (2007) <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) explored the link between caloric restriction (CR) and the logn life span of the Okinawan population, specifically those aged 65 and older. The research found that Okinawans have some of the longest life expectancies in the world, and their longevity can be attributed to mild, long-term caloric restriction. This population historically consumed a nutrient-dense, low-calorie diet, combined with high physical activity levels, which may have contributed to lower mortality from age-related diseases and extended survival. The study suggests that energy deficits in early life led to adaptations that promoted healthier aging and a longer lifespan.\n",

    "We hypothesize that there is a higher, positive correlation between the supply of plant-based foods and life expectancy in comparison to supply of animal-based foods and life expectancy. We can infer that a country's supply of certain foods is direclty related to their consumption, and therefore we expect longer life expectancies in countries with a higher supply of plant-based foods compared to animal-based.\n",
"Why: Blue Zones have consistently shown high life expectancies, which are attributed to their residents' diets that are rich in plant-based foods, healthy fats, and antioxidants.  We believe that the nutrients in these diets, such as omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, contribute to reduced inflammation, improved cardiovascular health, and a lower incidence of chronic diseases, all of which may lead to longer lifespans. By looking specifically at countries with Blue Zones (Italy, Greece, Costa Rica, Japan, and the U.S.) compared to countries with a larger supply of animal-based products, we can analyze the relationship between supply of food and life expectancy."

    "The FAOSTAT food supply dataset provides information on daily per capita availability of calories, protein, and fat across different countries and years and separated by plant or animal-based foods. The key variables include Food Supply (kcal/capita/day), which measures the average caloric intake available per person per day, Protein Supply (g/capita/day) and Fat Supply (g/capita/day), which quantify the availability of macronutrients. These metrics, reported as numerical values (float64), serve as proxies for national dietary patterns and potential nutritional adequacy. While they do not directly measure individual consumption, they reflect broader trends in the types of food available and certain macronutrient intakes within a country. The data is already tidy and does not contain any null values, so to clean it we just need to drop the columns that are not important for our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Life Expectancy and Death Rate datasets provided by the World Bank Group are measures of the average life expectancy at birth and the death rate per 1000 people. Each dataset has observations at the individual country level and per year. The measure of life expectancy is in years and death rate is the number of deaths per 1000 people in a country. These data needed lots of tidying and cleaning, first by dropping the metadata at the top that interfered with reading in the files. Then we had to drop unnecessary columns, convert data to a different type, melt the dataframes, filter to data from 2010-2022 to match the FAOSTAT data, and finally merge the two. We merged these two to create a comprehensive health dataset that had both life expectancy and death rate. "

    "Acknowledge and address any ethics & privacy related issues of your question(s), proposed dataset(s), and/or analyses. Use the information provided in lecture to guide your group discussion and thinking. If you need further guidance, check out [Deon's Ethics Checklist](http://deon.drivendata.org/#data-science-ethics-checklist). In particular:.\n",

    "- Are there any biases/privacy/terms of use issues with the data you propsed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample Bias - looking at specific areas such as blue zones can have very specified demographic groups, including those who have access to specific foods, socioeconomic factors, and diversity of genetics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy issues - As with all data science projects, personal privacy is always a concern, however we can create anonymity and transparency for potential participants. In instances of using outside datasets, we will make sure the data were collected ethically and anonymously as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are there potential biases in your dataset(s), in terms of who it composes, and how it was collected, that may be problematic in terms of it allowing for equitable analysis? (For example, does your data exclude particular populations, or is it likely to reflect particular human biases in a way that could be a problem?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Potentially. If we do end up looking at blue zones, there is a chance that specific demographics will be looked at more than others, which would in turn bias to a particular diet due to culture and/or location. This could bias our findings towards a particular dietary pattern or health behavior associated with those regions, potentially overlooking other factors that contribute to longevity or well-being in different populations. To ensure a more equitable analysis, it would be crucial to account for these biases by expanding the dataset to include a broader variety of populations and carefully considering how factors like culture, geography, and access to resources impact the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How will you set out to detect these specific biases before, during, and after/when communicating your analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Analysis: To detect biases before analysis, we will carefully select ethically produced/diverse datasets to ensure that diverse demographics and regions are represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "During Analysis: While analyzing the data, we will use exploratory data analysis (EDA) to check for imbalances in key variables and perform bias testing to ensure no group is disproportionately affecting the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "After Analysis: After completing the analysis, we will communicate the potential biases via a limitations section, discussing how they may have impacted the findings. By acknowledging these limitations, we’ll ensure the audience understands the scope and context of the results and provide recommendations for future research to address any gaps in representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are there any other issues related to your topic area, data, and/or analyses that are potentially problematic in terms of data privacy and equitable impact?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethical Implications of Findings: If the analysis leads to conclusions that could have a disproportionate impact on certain communities—such as promoting specific diets or lifestyle habits based on the findings—there's a risk that recommendations may not be culturally appropriate, feasible, or accessible for all populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How will you handle issues you identified?\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest way to handle these potential issues is ultimately acknowledging these potential limitations.  We will also ensure our lifestyle recommendations promote accessibility for all communities, not just those with more resources or higher socioeconomic status."
