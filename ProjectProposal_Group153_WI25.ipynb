    "Several factors influence an individual's lifespan, including genetics, environmental conditions, behavior, and diet. Genetics determines our susceptibility to certain diseases and influences our body’s ability to repair itself. Environmental factors like air quality, access to healthcare, and socioeconomic status also play a role in longevity. Behaviors such as physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and stress management significantly impact health outcomes. Diet, however, is one of the most modifiable factors affecting lifespan. A balanced diet can prevent chronic diseases, reduce inflammation, and support overall health. The goal of our project is to investigate how specific dietary patterns contribute to a longer lifespan. We aim to identify which diets or nutrients may help reduce the risk of age-related diseases and promote longevity.\n",
    "\n",
    "A study by Caprara (2018) <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) analyzed how different diets reduce non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs are diseases that do not transfer from person to person through infectious agents (heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and chronic lung disease). In the study, Caprara examined seven different dietary patterns to assess their potential in reducing the prevalence and impact of these conditions. The diets studied included the Mediterranean diet, known for its emphasis on healthy fats, fruits, and vegetables; the Japanese diet, which is rich in fish, rice, and plant-based foods; the vegetarian diet, which eliminates animal products; the new Nordic diet, which focuses on locally sourced, seasonal foods; the fast-mimicking diet, which simulates the effects of fasting while still providing essential nutrients; and the caloric restriction diet, which involves reducing calorie intake without malnutrition.These diets, common in Blue Zones where people live longer, share key features: high intake of plant-based foods, whole grains, unsaturated fats, and moderate protein, with a focus on omega-3s and antioxidants. They also limit red meat, processed foods, and sugars. Caprara also claimed that adopting a plant-based diet, alongside intermittent fasting and active living, can significantly reduce NCD risk and promote a longer, healthier life.\n",
    "\n",
    "A study by Willcox et al. (2007) <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) explored the link between caloric restriction (CR) and the logn life span of the Okinawan population, specifically those aged 65 and older. The research found that Okinawans have some of the longest life expectancies in the world, and their longevity can be attributed to mild, long-term caloric restriction. This population historically consumed a nutrient-dense, low-calorie diet, combined with high physical activity levels, which may have contributed to lower mortality from age-related diseases and extended survival. The study suggests that energy deficits in early life led to adaptations that promoted healthier aging and a longer lifespan.\n",

    "- We predict that diets similar to those found in Blue Zones, such as the Mediterranean and plant-based diets, will show a positive correlation with longer life expectancy in the United States, particularly in regions where these dietary patterns are more prevalent.\n",
    "- Why: Blue Zones have consistently shown high life expectancies, which are attributed to their residents' diets that are rich in plant-based foods, healthy fats, and antioxidants. Based on this, we hypothesize that areas in the U.S. that also adopt similar dietary patterns will have higher average life expectancies. We believe that the nutrients in these diets, such as omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, contribute to reduced inflammation, improved cardiovascular health, and a lower incidence of chronic diseases, all of which may lead to longer lifespans. Ultimately, demographics that eat these foods more often will most likely include areas of higher socioeconomic status to afford diverse and healthy food options.\n"

    "\n",
    " The ideal datasets we would want to answer this question would have detailed information about peoples’ dietary trends in different U.S. states. It would include variables such as the average lifespan on a state/county level, geographic information, frequency of consumption of different foods ( fruits and vegetables, meat, dairy, processed food, omega-3 rich foods, etc.), demographic information like age, gender, and income, and pre-existing health conditions such as heart-disease, diabetes, or obesity. This dataset would ideally have hundreds of thousands of observations to provide a strong sample that can be generalized to the U.S. population. This data would be collected continuously over a period of time so we could compare how different diets affect long-term health. The data would be collected by the CDC, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the USDA and stored as CSV files. This dataset would let us compare diets in regions with high life expectancy to those in regions with low life expectancy, while controlling for factors like income, demographics, and health conditions.\n",
    "2. Search for potential **real** datasets that could provide you with something useful for this project.  You do not have to find every piece of data you will use, but you do need to have demonstrated some idea that (a) this data is gettable and (b) that this data may be different from what your ideal is.\n",
    "\n",
    " Some potential datasets we found to use for this project are Blue Zones, Worldwide Meat Consumption, Global Food Prices, Fruits and Vegetable Prices (in major US cities), Heart Disease Indicators, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and Human Life Expectancy Around the World. With the Blue Zones and Human Life Expectancy Around the World datasets we can analyze the life expectancy across the U.S. and begin comparing regions with high vs. low life expectancy. We could use the Heart Disease Indicators dataset to see what effect fruit and vegetable consumption and pre-existing health conditions had on lifespan. The Global Food Prices and Fruits and Vegetable Prices datasets would let us extend our research to see what affect the cost of foods had on peoples’ consumption of them. The NHANES data has valuable information about diet, demographics, medical conditions, and mortality information that we can use in our project.\n"

    "\n",
    " Potentially. If we do end up looking at blue zones, there is a chance that specific demographics will be looked at more than others, which would in turn bias to a particular diet due to culture and/or location. This could bias our findings towards a particular dietary pattern or health behavior associated with those regions, potentially overlooking other factors that contribute to longevity or well-being in different populations. To ensure a more equitable analysis, it would be crucial to account for these biases by expanding the dataset to include a broader variety of populations and carefully considering how factors like culture, geography, and access to resources impact the data.\n",
    "- How will you set out to detect these specific biases before, during, and after/when communicating your analysis?\n",

    " After Analysis: After completing the analysis, we will communicate the potential biases via a limitations section, discussing how they may have impacted the findings. By acknowledging these limitations, we’ll ensure the audience understands the scope and context of the results and provide recommendations for future research to address any gaps in representation.\n",

    " Ethical Implications of Findings: If the analysis leads to conclusions that could have a disproportionate impact on certain communities—such as promoting specific diets or lifestyle habits based on the findings—there's a risk that recommendations may not be culturally appropriate, feasible, or accessible for all populations.\n",
    "- How will you handle issues you identified?\n",
    "\n",
    " The biggest way to handle these potential issues is ultimately acknowledging these potential limitations.  We will also ensure our lifestyle recommendations promote accessibility for all communities, not just those with more resources or higher socioeconomic status."
